**RETURN OF CREEEED**

Considering my lack of involvement with Echoes and the fact that I felt my old 6.5 Stuff in EOT was kind of sub-par, I decided to re-do it in a way that doesn't overlap.

This mod adds many new types of 6.5 Creedmoor ammo, none of which shared compatibility with Echoes' Creed, as that would fundamentally break the balance of the rounds.
