**AK-50 is here and it's really heavy.**

This mod is simply a backport of the AK-50 from the newest Tarkov Patch that came out like 6 hours ago (at time of release in the UK.) Everything is set to the existing data that was found by scrubbing the changelogs. 
The only difference here is that the trader prices and Loyalty Levels are set differently to Live, as I don't feel like adding a questline to unlock this thing. By default this weapon's modslots are compatible with other mods suchs as Epic's AIO, TCG and ECOT.
